# InstanceHarvestor

InstanceHarvestor relinks duplicated objects in Blender based on their mesh signatures. It automates the process of reducing redundant mesh data, optimizing scenes.

## What does it do?

- Relinks duplicate meshes based on the mesh signature. Works even when the mesh data is renamed.
- Option to operate only on selected objects and match materials.
- ⚠️ Use with caution on important files. Collisions are rare but possible.

## Installation

1. Download the `InstanceHarvestor.zip` file from release.
2. In Blender, go to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install`.
3. Enable the addon.

## Usage

Go to `Object > Relink Duplicates` in the 3D View or search the operator "Relink Duplicates".
